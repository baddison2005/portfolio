<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am a seasoned astrophysicist transitioning into data science, with 15 years of experience in data analysis and Python programming to explore exoplanets and study fundamental constants. My expertise includes extracting insights from complex datasets using world-class telescopes, authoring over 50 scientific papers, and presenting research findings globally. I'm enthusiastic about applying this expertise to solve real-world data science challenges, driving innovation, and effectively communicating complex insights to both teams and clients.

## Professional Experience:
**Postdoctoral Researcher @ Swinburne University of Technology (Nov 2022 — Dec 2023)**
#### Postdoctoral Researcher @ Swinburne University of Technology (Nov 2022 — Dec 2023)
- Played an integral role in a research initiative measuring the fine structure constant to advance our knowledge of fundamental constants and cosmological models.
- Implemented a Python analysis pipeline to measure the fine structure constant using a novel technique of comparing the spectra of similar stars (star-to-star comparison).
- This resulted in reducing errors by 3 orders of magnitude compared to other approaches used for measuring the fine structure constant.
- Developed an analysis pipeline in Python to classify the evolutionary state of giant stars using a novel differential equivalent width technique.
- This resulted in improving the accuracy of classification by 90% compared to other techniques.
