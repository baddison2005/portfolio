<hr style="height:4px; visibility:hidden;" />
<p class="summary">
I am a seasoned astrophysicist transitioning into data science, with 15 years of experience in data analysis and Python programming to explore exoplanets and study fundamental constants. My expertise includes extracting insights from complex datasets using world-class telescopes, authoring over 50 scientific papers, and presenting research findings globally. I'm enthusiastic about applying this expertise to solve real-world data science challenges, driving innovation, and effectively communicating complex insights to both teams and clients.

<h2 class="section-title">Professional Experience</h2>
<h4 class="role">Freelance Data Scientist @ Upwork (<em>Jul 2025 — Present</em>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Provide end-to-end analytics for Upwork clients that includes cleaning complex datasets (pandas), building and validating ML models (scikit-learn), and delivering clear visualisations (Matplotlib/Bokeh) to support data-driven decisions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="role">Casual Lecturer in Physics/Astronomy @ University of Southern Queensland (<em>Aug 2024 — Present</em>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Developed and delivered targeted assessments aligned with learning outcomes to evaluate student comprehension and engagement.</li>
  <li>Led weekly tutorials that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, preparing students for real-world applications as well as academic careers.</li>
  <li>Collaborated with colleagues to continuously improve course content and delivery, ensuring a comprehensive educational experience at the University of Southern Queensland.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="role">Postdoctoral Researcher @ Swinburne University of Technology (<em>Nov 2022 — Dec 2023</em>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Played an integral role in a research initiative measuring the fine structure constant to advance our knowledge of fundamental constants and cosmological models.</li>
  <li>Implemented a Python analysis pipeline to measure the fine structure constant using a novel technique of comparing the spectra of similar stars (star-to-star comparison).</li>
  <li>This resulted in reducing errors by 3 orders of magnitude compared to other approaches used for measuring the fine structure constant.</li>
  <li>Developed an analysis pipeline in Python to classify the evolutionary state of giant stars using a novel differential equivalent width technique.</li>
  <li>This resulted in improving the accuracy of classification by 90% compared to other techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="role">Research Fellow @ University of Southern Queensland (<em>Aug 2018 — Jul 2022</em>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Led ground-based observations of key exoplanet candidates using the MINERVA-Australis Telescope array.</li>
  <li>Collaborated with over 40 international researchers at MIT, Harvard, George Mason University, NASA, Sydney Uni, and UNSW to schedule and organise ground-based telescope observing.</li>
  <li>Designed and implemented data ingestion and analysis pipelines in python to transform raw data into science ready data products and then synthesized results into 23 scientific publications.</li>
  <li>This resulted in the discovery of nearly 50 exoplanets, including the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1431b, one of the hottest planets ever discovered.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="role">Postdoctoral Researcher @ Mississippi State University (<em>Dec 2015 — Jun 2018</em>)</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Built the Starchive database of over 30,000 objects using PostgreSQL, Python, and SQLAlchemy for data handling; collaborated on schema design to accommodate diverse data sources.</li>
  <li>Employed Matplotlib and Pandas in Python to visualise and analyse patterns in the stellar and planetary property data, informing selection of interesting candidates to pursue.</li>
  <li>Created automated pipelines to handle ongoing ingestion of data, with embedded validation checks to ensure data quality.</li>
  <li>This resulted in reducing manual data entry by 99% and enabling faster data retrieval times, allowing the team to focus on higher-level analysis and boosting productivity.</li>

  <h2 class="section-title">Data Science Projects</h2>
  <h4 class="role">Predicting the Orbital Tilts of Exoplanets Using Machine Learning</h4>
  <p>I developed random forest regression and classification models using the Python library Scikit-learn to predict exoplanetary orbital obliquities (tilts). I worked with datasets containing exoplanet and host star properties, addressing challenges such as small sample size, data imbalance, and weak predictive features. This project provided me with skills in applying machine learning to real-world datasets. I documented the process through a series of blog posts, available <a href="https://www.astrobrett.com/data_science.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and shared the Jupyter notebooks with the models on <a href="https://github.com/baddison2005?tab=repositories" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      Illustration of a random forest model consisting of N number of decision trees, with each tree consisting of M number of branches (or nodes), similar to how a forest consists of many trees and each tree consists of many branches. The nodes within each decision tree are used to make a prediction, and all of the predictions are averaged together to produce a final result. The red path taken in each decision tree is where specific criteria are met that result in a prediction.
