## Professional Experience:
**Casual Lecturer in Physics/Astronomy @ University of Southern Queensland (_Aug 2024 — Present_)**
- Developed and delivered targeted assessments aligned with learning outcomes to evaluate student comprehension and engagement.
- Led weekly tutorials that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, preparing students for real-world applications as well as academic careers.
- Collaborated with colleagues to continuously improve course content and delivery, ensuring a comprehensive educational experience at the University of Southern Queensland.

**Postdoctoral Researcher @ Swinburne University of Technology (_Nov 2022 — Dec 2023_)**
- Played an integral role in a research initiative measuring the fine structure constant to advance our knowledge of fundamental constants and cosmological models.
- Implemented a Python analysis pipeline to measure the fine structure constant using a novel technique of comparing the spectra of similar stars (star-to-star comparison).
- This resulted in reducing errors by 3 orders of magnitude compared to other approaches used for measuring the fine structure constant.
- Developed an analysis pipeline in Python to classify the evolutionary state of giant stars using a novel differential equivalent width technique.
- This resulted in improving the accuracy of classification by 90% compared to other techniques.

**Research Fellow @ University of Southern Queensland (_Aug 2018 — Jul 2022_)**
- Led ground-based observations of key exoplanet candidates using the MINERVA-Australis Telescope array.
- Collaborated with over 40 international researchers at MIT, Harvard, George Mason University, NASA, Sydney Uni, and UNSW to schedule and organise ground-based telescope observing.
- Designed and implemented data ingestion and analysis pipelines in python to transform raw data into science ready data products and then synthesized results into 23 scientific publications.
- This resulted in the discovery of nearly 50 exoplanets, including the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1431b, one of the hottest planets ever discovered.

**Postdoctoral Researcher @ Mississippi State University (_Dec 2015 — Jun 2018_)**
- Built the Starchive database of over 30,000 objects using PostgreSQL, Python, and SQLAlchemy for data handling; collaborated on schema design to accommodate diverse data sources.
- Employed Matplotlib and Pandas in Python to visualise and analyse patterns in the stellar and planetary property data, informing selection of interesting candidates to pursue.
- Created automated pipelines to handle ongoing ingestion of data, with embedded validation checks to ensure data quality.
- This resulted in reducing manual data entry by 99% and enabling faster data retrieval times, allowing the team to focus on higher-level analysis and boosting productivity.
