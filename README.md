## Professional Experience:
**Lecturer in Physics/Astronomy @ UniSQ (_Aug 2024 — Present_)**
- Developed and delivered targeted assessments aligned with learning outcomes to evaluate student comprehension and engagement.
- Led weekly tutorials that promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, preparing students for real-world applications as well as academic careers.
- Collaborated with colleagues to continuously improve course content and delivery, ensuring a comprehensive educational experience at the University of Southern Queensland.

**Postdoctoral Researcher @ Swinburne (_Nov 2022 — Dec 2023_)**
- Played an integral role in a research initiative measuring the fine structure constant to advance our knowledge of fundamental constants and cosmological models.
- Implemented a Python analysis pipeline to measure the fine structure constant using a novel technique of comparing the spectra of similar stars (star-to-star comparison).
- This resulted in reducing errors by 3 orders of magnitude compared to other approaches used for measuring the fine structure constant.
- Developed an analysis pipeline in Python to classify the evolutionary state of giant stars using a novel differential equivalent width technique.
- This resulted in improving the accuracy of classification by 90% compared to other techniques.
